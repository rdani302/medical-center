            <p>Living a healthy lifestyle involves making small, consistent choices that enhance overall well-being. Start by eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats while limiting sugar and processed foods. Stay physically active with at least 30 minutes of daily exercise, such as walking or yoga, to boost energy and reduce stress. Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support focus, mood, and immune function. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and maintain digestion, energy, and skin health. Lastly, manage stress through relaxation techniques, hobbies, or time with loved ones, ensuring balance in both body and mind. Small steps taken daily can lead to a healthier, happier life.
